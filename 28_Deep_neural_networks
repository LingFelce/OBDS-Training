Deep neural networks in genomics - 22nd October 2019

Deep learning in genomics - Zou et al Nature Genetics 2019 (base calling etc)

Neural networks - probability modelled by sigmoidal curve (0 for false, 1 for true)
Tweak parameters to get best predictions (Input data - observations as training set)
Create different networks/pathways to combine parameters to get single output (non-linear) - prediction

Non-linear models - more power - Gokcen Nature Reviews Genetics 2019 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0122-6)
(lots of figures from presentation are from this paper!)
Single-layer neural network (logistic regression) v multilayer neural network
Non-linear activation - taking something linear and making it non-linear (remove values below 0?)
Optimise parameters; minimise loss function l by calculating gradient (dl/d0 - differentiation) in 2D

Training process:
  start with random parameters
  take batch of inputs
  calculate predictions
  calculate performance (loss)
  calculate gradient for every parameter
  adjust parameters along gradient
go back to 2. until no noticeable improvement in performance

Training set, validation set and test set
Validation set used to monitor for performance loss eg overfitting (don't want to memorise training set, want to be more generalised)

Network types (and input examples)
  fully connected (number of k-mer matches)
  convolutional (DNA, a.a sequence, image)
  recurrent (DNA, aa.sequence, time)
  graph convolutional (protein-protein network, protein structure)
  
Convolutional networks for image analysis
  Convert 4x4 grid of greyscale values into single value by applying filter (can parameterise)
  Use for edge detection (use Sobel operator as filter)
  More complexity when have deeper layers
  
Convolutional networks for DNA
  apply filter to DNA sequence - hot coded sequence - transform DNA sequence into binary sequence 
  (table of 4 rows by x columns where x = length of sequence)
  score - how well does motif match particular sequence? Remove all negative values before continuing to next layer
  
Convolutional neural networks in genomics
  chromatin feature networks - transcription factor binding sites, open chromatin, histone marks
  apply ~300 filters for first layer - work out number of filters and actual values by iteration
  scan genome every ~1kb
