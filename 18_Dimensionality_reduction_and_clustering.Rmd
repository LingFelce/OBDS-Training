#Dimensionality reduction and clustering (statistics) 8th October 2019

##Dimensionality reduction
Many genes not interesting as don't vary a lot, or don't have enough counts - filtering needed
Use dimensionality reduction methods to find structure in data, aid visualisation
Unsupervised learning for finding groups of homogenous items eg PCA or t-SNE

##Principal component analysis
Find linear combo of variables to create principal components, maintain most variance in data
Principal components uncorrelated (orthogonal to each other) and ordered with respect to % variance
Assumes relationship between variables is linear
Spectral decomposition, singular value decomposition
Centre data first (mean centre), scale data if using different units (use correlation matrix instead of covariance matrix)
Visualise top genes associated with principal components (PC1 or PC2)
