Further intro to machine learning 24th October 2019

Artificial intelligence vs machine learning

2 main classes of algorithms: 
  supervised (input data + desired outcome)  - linear regression, neural networks, perceptron. Answer a question - right or wrong
  unsupervised (input data only) - PCA, k-means, t-SNE, UMAP. Dimensionality reduction, visualisation, computational efficiency

Exercises using iris dataset from sklearn, done in Jupyter Lab (export at HTML)
