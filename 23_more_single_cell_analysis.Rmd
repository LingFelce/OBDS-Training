Stages of data processing and appropriate downstream applications
Measured:
  Raw - statistical testing (differential gene expression)
  Normalised (+ log transformed)
Corrected:
  Corrected (technical) - visual comparison of data
  Corrected (bioogical) - pre-processing for trajectory inference
Reduced:
  Featured selected - visualisation, trajectory inference
  Dimensionality reduced - visualisation, clustering, trajectory inference

Downstream analyses after QC and normalisation:
Cell level - cluster analysis, trajectory analysis, compositional analysis, metastable states,
  cluster annotation, gene expression dynamics
Gene level - differential expression analysis, gene set analysis, gene regulatory networks

Clustering - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clustree/vignettes/clustree.html
