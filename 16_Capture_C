Chromosome conformation capture techniques (often abbreviated to 3C technologies or 3C-based methods) are a set of molecular biology 
methods used to analyze the spatial organization of chromatin in a cell. 
These methods quantify the number of interactions between genomic loci that are nearby in 3-D space, but may be separated by many 
nucleotides in the linear genome. Such interactions may result from biological functions, such as promoter-enhancer interactions, 
or from random polymer looping, where undirected physical motion of chromatin causes loci to collide.
Interaction frequencies may be analyzed directly, or they may be converted to distances and used to reconstruct 3-D structures.
Sequence capture-based methods
A number of methods use oligonucleotide capture to enrich 3C and Hi-C libraries for specific loci of interest.
These methods include Capture-C, NG Capture-C, Capture-3C, and Capture Hi-C.
These methods are able to produce higher resolution and sensitivity than 4C based methods.
